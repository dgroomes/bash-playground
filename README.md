# bash-playground

ðŸ“š Learning and exploring Bash and the shell in general; capturing useful snippets that I would otherwise too easily forget.


## Overview

This is a somewhat hap-hazard collection of command-line stuff, not just Bash. The project is split into the following
directories.


### `misc/`

Miscellaneous scripts and scratch content.

See the README in [misc/](misc/).


### `fzf/`

Learning and exploring `fzf` <https://github.com/junegunn/fzf> -- a command-line fuzzy finder.

See the README in [fzf/](fzf/).


### `perl/`

Learning and exploring Perl <https://www.perl.org/>.

See the README in [perl/](perl/).


## Wish List

General clean-ups, TODOs and things I wish to implement for this project:

* [ ] Add `xargs` examples
* [ ] Make an example with a fifo (a.k.a "named pipe")
