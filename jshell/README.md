# jshell

NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

Learning and exploring `jshell`--the Java shell that ships with OpenJDK.

---

Can I run a Java application and then attach a jshell session and just poke around the various objects in my Java
process and execute arbitrary Java code? This seems like a good way to learn language features of Java or explore 
methods of a library (e.g. [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson)) or framework (e.g. [Spring](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework)).
